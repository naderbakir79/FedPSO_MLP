#  A Hybrid Aggregation Approach for Federated Learning to Improve Energy Consumption in Smart Buildings
For this purpose, the study proposed the implementation of the federated learning framework, which is a hybrid model FedPSO-MLP consisting of an MLP combined with PSO that can demonstrate optimization of the MLP network architecture and improvement in the network communication performance by modifying the clarity and form of clientâ€™s data during transmission in servers.
In addition, the experiments undertaken demonstrated that the proposed FedPSO-MLP outperformed the most popular Federated Averaging algorithm FedAvg, by resulting in a
reduction of error by approximately 75%. The outperformance and higher flexibility of the FedPSO-MLP over FedAvg were comprehended based on the several model criteria discussed (RMSE, MAE, and MSE). Furthermore, the hybrid algorithm significantly reduced the communication cost and data used in the network communication as well as improved the global model accuracy by an average of 96% <br><br>
